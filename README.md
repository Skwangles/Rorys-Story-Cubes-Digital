# Story-Cubes
Made for language learning, the story cubes game. 


I have digitalisd Rory's Story Cubes (Actions) to be played anywhere. 

To Play: Select the cubes you'd like to use(Or randomize them) and then click Roll. 
The randomized images depending to the Die will show up.
Now you can create a story using the images shown of the actions. 


Enjoy!
